# Pikku URL

A URL shortener that I'm building just for the fun of it.

This is still a work in progress! I'll be updating this readme as I go, but for now it is what it is.

## ðŸ§¬ Project Structure

- [`web/`](./web/): the frontend part of the project. Currently contains both client's UI and client's logic.
- [`server/`](./server/): a very basic server that shortens and stores the links.

## âœ¨ Available Scripts

- `pnpm start`: run server and web dev server.
- `pnpm test`: run tests, linters & formatting check.
- `pnpm format`: format code in all workspaces.
